# Carlos CASTA - Flappy Bird

This projet was developed between February and March 2018 during the course Machine Learning at ISAE-SUPAERO as a final challenge for the engineering students.

A simple description of the projet would be: A Flappy Bird bot in Python, that learns from each game played via Q-Learning.


# Installation Dependencies:

Python 3.63
Pygame
PLE (PyGame Learning Environment)

Note that this version of FlappyBird in PLE has been slightly changed to make the challenge a bit easier: the background is turned to plain black, the bird and pipe colors are constant (red and green respectively).
